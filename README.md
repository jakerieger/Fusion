# Fusion

## Introduction

**Fusion** is a dynamically-typed, interpreted server scripting language designed to be as simple as possible to use while
providing
all the common tools a network professional would need. This means first-class support for networking protocols such as HTTP/S,
WebSocket and Raw TCP/UDP, as well as an easy interface in to system commands.

## Why?

**Fusion** was developed for use on backend servers. Shell scripts are combersome
and environment dependent and Python/Ruby/Lua offer too much out of the box for simple system scripting. Fusion intends to
fill that gap and provide network and system professionals with the best tool for the job.
